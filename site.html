    <h1>A Foxy Story</h1>

	<p>The quick brown fox jumped over the log.</p>
    
    <p> A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.
        
        The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.
        
        Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.
        
        "What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."
        
        And off he walked very, very scornfully.
